            Hello and thank you for visiting my page! This photo is of me and Anna. We have two dogs and two cats and live in North Kansas City. Bruni is a chocolate lab and Macie is... a mut. 
            I am really excited to be taking this course and I look forward to using my creativity to create and build websites. I currently work at Cerner where I am a Test Analyst. I test software and write test scripts, as well as plan for releases and manage defects. There are always so many defects. I enjoy traveling and the coolest place I have been is Costa Rica. 
            My early career was a teacher. I taught Special education, Algebra, and Geometry. I also coached basketball, volleyball, and softball. I decided to change careers 4 years ago and made a move into Health IT. Since then I have put myself in any environment I can to learn and grow. Doing something is better than doing nothing. That's why I go with the moto, "Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly." I am excited to launch into this new learning!
        </p>
